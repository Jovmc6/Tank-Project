# Tank-Project
Introduction: In my project I designed a Tank where I powered a Tiva board to power the tank I wrote the code in C and how it works is that we flash our code to the Tiva board then based off our pinout we hooked it up to our breadboard where we put our ADAfruit module to power the motors on the tank.




















In our project we utilized GPIO and PWM and hope to add UART or SPI to control it from our phone and use the modules to power them. I was able to achieve my goals as this project is the first project where I applied my hardware and software skills to a real world application and hope to be able to do this on a bigger scale in the future.
